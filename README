railspdf

Adds pdf-writer support to Rails

Usage
-----

To begin rendering PDFs, simply create a view with a .pdf.writer extension and paste in the code:

  pdf.select_font "Times-Roman"
  pdf.text "Hello, World", :font_size => 72, :justification => :center

**Important** If you are using a layout, you must disable it for the view!!! 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Controller Extensions
---------------------

	A rails_pdf method is mixed in which allows you to easily set
	various configuration options (previous the settings were handled
	with instance variables).  The options are:

	  :disposition -- :inline or :attachment
	  :filename    -- filename (for use with attachment disposition)
	  :writer      -- hash of options (sent to PDF::Writer on initialization)

	The defaults are as follows:
	  :disposition => :inline
	  :filename    => nil,
	  :writer      => { :paper => 'LETTER', :orientation => :portrait }
	
Sample Controller
-----------------

  class PagesController < ApplicationController
    def some_action
			rails_pdf :disposition => :attachment, 
			  :filename => 'Hello.pdf'
			
    	@content = "This is dynamic content!!!"
    end

		# Example of using writer configuration options
		def	another_action
		  rails_pdf :writer => {
		    :orientation => :landscape
		  }
		end
  end


Sample View (some_action.pdf.writer)
-----------

  pdf.select_font "Times-Roman"
  pdf.text @content, :font_size => 72, :justification => :center
